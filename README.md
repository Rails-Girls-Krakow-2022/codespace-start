# codespace-start

Use this repo as a starting point for the attendees’ projects
- Rails and bundler are included
- Sqlite should work out of the box
- Postgres will be running at the default port (5342)

**Important**: run `rails new .` to generate the app in the repository root, otherwise git is not going to like it.


Configuration based on [ruby-rails-postgres container](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-dev-containers/tree/v0.236.0/containers/ruby-rails-postgres).
